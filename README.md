# Unity2DPlatformer
I have been working on unreal for the past 2 years. This is my attempt to test my Game Development Skills in Unity. I would be trying to make a 2D Platformer Game. 
All the assets are available on https://www.gameart2d.com/freebies.html for free. 
The player when moves left of the screen, teleports to right and vice versa. Same is the case when player falls down. The zombies will try to walk towards the centre and the player has to protect the tresure.
